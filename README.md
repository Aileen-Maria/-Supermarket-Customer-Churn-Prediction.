# -Supermarket-Customer-Churn-Prediction.
A machine learning project to predict customer churn using classification algorithms, including preprocessing, model tuning, and testing on unseen data.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses classification models to predict whether a supermarket customer is likely to churn. The dataset includes features such as age, credit score, product price, and more.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

## 📈 Final Results
Achieved a test accuracy of **78.05%** using a Random Forest Classifier with SMOTE and hyperparameter tuning.

## 📁 How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the notebook on Google Colab
3. Run all cells and check the output
